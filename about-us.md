# About Us

We're building Splittable because we know that living with other people sucks sometimes. But it doesn't have to. We want it to be brilliant. We hate awkward conversations about money and the stress it causes flatmates.

Home isn’t just about the house - it’s about the people. We want Splittable to foster happiness in the home, making you a smarter, more effective and less stressed housemate.

Our own housesharing experiences have shaped how we approach things, and we try to operate with the same values that we think make for happier houseshares :-)

### Collaborate

Every successful company, organisation and houseshare is comprised of a bunch of different personalities and skills coming together to operate as a finely tuned team. Like Lennon and McCartney (or Joey and Chandler?), we’re combining our own forces to create something great. We're all housesharers ourselves, so have worked with our housemates, as well as many other people and organisations, to make shared living simple. We love working with others and we hope you do too.

### Communicate

Our team loves to talk. We communicate early and often and promote full transparency. This is what Splittable is all about. It's what we are all about. We want our company relationships, like your houseshare, to be inclusive, with everyone on the same page, so will always let you, our housesharing community and our partners, know about what we’re up to. And if you’re interested, we use [Slack](http://slack.com) for chat, [Trello](http://trello.com), for tasks and [Google Apps](https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/) for everything else.

### Don't Be A Jerk

Our mantra of sharing and helping is founded on our belief that what goes around, comes around. In today’s digital world, companies owe a degree (a large degree!) of responsibility to their community. Would it be cool for us to sell all your data to a marketing agency and pocket the change? No. We’re in your corner. Since your trust in us is our priority, we don’t just think about whether we can do something, but whether we should do it. We want you on this journey with us and we think a little mindfulness can go a long way in keeping your co-workers, users, or housemates happy :)

## Company Commitments

### Accountability

Companies grow and evolve. We we will always let you know about these changes here and on social media or our blog. We'll also be publishing our values, terms and privacy pages [openly on Github](https://github.com/locatable/splittable-docs). This way you can see exactly what changes we make and hold us accountable.

### Community

We love nothing more than an actively involved community. We’re committed to having our users test new features and come in for more in-depth workshops (beer and pizza on us), so we can always be making improvements that reflect your needs.

### Information

We will always respect your privacy and data like it was our own. We tell you upfront what to expect and won't let any of your personal, identifying data outside our ecosystem without your knowledge and consent.

### Charity

We're committed to continue to support charities related to homelessness, affordable housing and other important areas of the housing sector. We also work with non-profit partners to fight for young renters like us.

### Fun

Do you have to ask? Just don't challenge Nick at ping pong.
